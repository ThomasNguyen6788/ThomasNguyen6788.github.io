            <p>A run and dodge game that stresses pattern decoding and endurance.
            In Turret Mayhem, your main goal is to avoid the red bullets being 
            fired by the four turrets on the walls which randomly switch between
            their four directions.</p>

            <p>Some great hurdles that I surpassed in the game's creation was
            getting the turrets to randomly turn at certain intervals and to broadcast 
            how the bullets were to be shot. However, I remember being stumped 
            in the process of registering when the player model touched a bullet, 
            the game was to acknowledge it with a loss screen (which I also struggled
            to create).</p>
