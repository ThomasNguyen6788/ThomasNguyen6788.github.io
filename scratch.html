            <h3>Turret Mayhem</h3>
            <img src="Turret_mayhem.png">
            <p>A run and dodge game that stresses pattern decoding and endurance.
            In Turret Mayhem, your main goal is to avoid the red bullets being 
            fired by the four turrets on the walls which randomly switch between
            their four directions.</p>

            <p>Some great hurdles that I surpassed in the game's creation was
            getting the turrets to randomly turn at certain intervals and to broadcast 
            how the bullets were to be shot. However, I remember being stumped 
            in the process of registering when the player model touched a bullet, 
            the game was to acknowledge it with a loss screen (which I also struggled
            to create).</p>

        <p>Decide how to spend your day in the life of a teenage boy while, at 
        the same time, defending your home from whoever may break in! Do you 
        go out with your trouble-making friends or do you stay home alone?</p>

        <p>When it comes to writing stories, I always try to think above and beyond 
        to keep the content interesting and reeling. However, I can't possibly code 
        all my imaginations out within a week, so compacting my ideas was the first 
        task along with where each turning point of the story would best be placed.
        A game development company named Telltale Games is popularly known for their
        "Walking Dead" Series where the player steers the storyline by deciding 
        events that could leave a character(s) compromised from the story
        permanently. This game genre caught my interest on sight which helped me 
        create my own story from watching so many captivating playthroughs. This
        project focused mainly on the "def" funtion, which allowed me to create
        my own function using other functions embed in the python program. By
        defining new functions, each new scene could more easily be distinguished 
        instead of having my code run from top to bottom like a ball in a pinball
        machine.</p>
